SWR comes with a nice function called `mutate` that let you change the cached data for a given key, it comes with multiple different options but one of the nicest one is to pass a function, get the current data and update it, from anywhere.

```ts
import { mutate } from "swr"

mutate("/api/me", user => ({ ...user, name: "Sergio" }))
```

This function update the name of the user cached as `/api/me`, and if there is a component subscribed to that cache key it will trigger a revalidation, this is however something we can disable passing a `false` as third argument.

If you see the example above we used restructuring to copy the `user` object, this is required because SWR uses object reference to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

Enter Immer, this small lib let you mutate an object while performing an immutable change, let's see the example updated

```ts
import { mutate } from "swr"
import produce from "immer'

mutate("/api/me", produce(user => {
  user.name = "Sergio"
}))
```

This `produce` function will receive a callback and it will execute it passing a "draft" copy of the object, in this draft we could mutate the object however we want, then produce will return a new function that receives the original object to mutate, it run our callback, and generate a new object with our changes applied, lastly it will return the new updated object.

Looks like a lot of work, and it is, however for the user of Immer it's only a few lines as we saw above, what will happen combined with `mutate` is that the returned function will be passed to `mutate` as we did before and it will receive the cached value, then it will return the updated value and it will update the cache, triggering a re-render of any component subscribed to that cache key.

And this is great because it allow use to implement Optimistic UI easier, let's see an example

```js
import React from 'react'
import useSWR, { mutate } from 'swr'
import produce from "immer"

async function fetcher(...args) {
  const res = await fetch(...args)
  return await res.json()
}
export default () => {
  const [text, setText] = React.useState('');
  const { data } = useSWR('/api/data', fetcher)

  async function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault()

    // in this mutate call we will optimistically update the UI
    mutate("/api/data", produce(draftData => {
      draftData.push(text) // here we push the new text
    }), false) // we don't trigger a revalidation

    // in this mutate call, we will POST the API and update the UI
    // if the update fails it will rollback the optimistic change
    await mutate('/api/data', await fetch('/api/data', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({ text })
    }))

    setText('') // after the update we clear the input
  }

  return <div>
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input
        type="text"
        onChange={event => setText(event.target.value)}
        value={text}
      />
      <button>Create</button>
    </form>
    <ul>
      {data ? data.map(datum => <li key={datum}>{datum}</li>) : 'loading...'}
    </ul>
  </div>
}
```
