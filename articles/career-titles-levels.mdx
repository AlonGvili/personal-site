This is a repetitive question and the answer usually vary between companies, some companies may have more levels or different titles, or even different meanings to each title and level.

This article will list them with an usual description for each one.

## Career Paths

Usually engineers have two possible career paths, the Engineer Way and the Management Way.

### The Engineer Way

You start usually as [Entry-Level](#entry-level) Software Engineer or some specialized field like [Frontend](#frontend-engineer), [Backend](#backend-engineer), [Web](#web-engineer), [Mobile](#mobile-engineer), etc.

You grow to [Mid-Level](#mid-level) Software Engineer, at this point you could move to [FullStack Engineer](#fullstack-engineer), you usually start specialized in some area.

After this you will grow to [Senior](#senior) and eventually to [Principal](#principal), at those points you could change title to [Architect](#software-architect) or [Tech Lead](#tech-lead), even to be [SRE](#site-reliability-engineer).

If you move titles you could lose your seniority but you usually never go back to Entry-Level, this mean if you are Senior Software Engineer you could move to Mid-Level Software Architect and then grow again to Senior Software Architect, same with SRE

### The Management Way

Another possible career path is the management way. It starts the same way but after reaching a Senior level the Software Engineer migrate to management roles. This could start with being Tech Lead, then Software Engineering Manager, VP of Engineer and at the end CTO.

## Levels

Levels are appended to a title, some companies have two or three levels, bigger companies add more levels reaching up to ten levels at most the biggest ones, but note there is no limit, you could keep creating levels and use them to justify bigger salaries.

### Entry-Level

An Entry-Level is someone with minimum knowledge about their area. This is also known as Junior. Everyone starts being a Entry-Level at some point in their career and will eventually grow to the next level.

The Entry-Level are expected to have a bigger level member of they team to mentor them and guide him on how to do they job and teach them best practices.

### Mid-Level

When the Entry-Level are ready to work alone they become Mid-Level, also known as Semi Senior. The Mid-Level is expected to have enough experience to be assigned to a task and work mostly alone without being guided.

They could, and probably should, have a bigger level member of its team to mentor them.

### Senior

The Senior are a team member with enough experience to not only work without guidance but also start contributing with decision taking. They are expected to mentor other team members and work in helping them be more productive.

In most companies this is the higher level you could achieve in a single career path.

### Principal

Usually after reaching a Senior level most people, doesn't matter the title, migrate to Management roles, if they don't then the next level is Principal. A Principal is expected to have knowledge across the project and whatever they use to create it.

In engineering they are also usually Architects.

## Titles

### Quality Assurance Engineer

The Quality Assurance Engineer, or just QA, is a kind of Software Engineer who is in charge of creating automated tests and verifying the quality of the product doing manual tests. They report the bugs they found to the rest of the Software Engineers so they could fix them or they just fix them.
