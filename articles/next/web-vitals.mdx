To get a report on [Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/) while using Next.js create a `pages/_app.js`, if you don't already have one, and add the following line:

```ts
export function reportWebVitals(metric) {
  console.log(metric);
}
```

Next.js will automatically start to keep track of multiple metrics and give you back a report. The metrics we can track include:

- [Time to First Byte](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Time_to_first_byte) (TTFB)
- [First Contentful Paint](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/First_contentful_paint) (FCP)
- [Largest Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/lcp/) (LCP)
- [First Input Delay](https://web.dev/fid/) (FID)
- [Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/) (CLS)
- Next.js-hydration
- Next.js-route-change-to-render
- Next.js-render

_Next.js-hydration_ is the amount of time it takes a page to start and finish hydrating the HTML.

_Next.js-route-change-to-render_ is the amount of time it takes a page to start rendering after a route change.

_Next.js-render_ is the amount of time it takes a page to finish rendering after a route change.

If you want to learn more about the first five follow the links above.

Once you have the report you can start tracking them however your prefer, if you are using Google Analytics you could replace the `console.log` with:

```js
export function reportWebVitals({ id, name, label, value }) {
  ga("send", "event", {
    eventCategory: `Next.js ${label} metric`,
    eventAction: name,
    eventValue: Math.round(name === "CLS" ? value * 1000 : value), // values must be integers
    eventLabel: id, // id unique to current page load
    nonInteraction: true, // avoids affecting bounce rate.
  });
}
```

Now we will start sending those metric to Google Analytics and keep track of them, we could then use them to detect slow pages and fix them.
