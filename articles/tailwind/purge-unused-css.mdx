[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) now comes with built-in support to purge the unused CSS, to use this creeate, if you don't already have, a `tailwind.config.js` file in your project root, inside it export an object, using CommonJS syntax, and there define a property `purge` with an array of the globs to use to find which files are using Tailwind.

```js
module.exports = {
  purge: [
    "./src/**/*.{ts,tsx}"
  ],
};
```

In our example we are searching for any `.ts` or `.tsx` file inside any level of folders inside the `src` folder in the root.

We could also disable it by passing `false` instead of an array.

```js
module.exports = {
  purge: false
};
```

This is helpful if we are purging them using another tool.
