### Teaching

I can give a **workshops** and **mentorship** for you or your company.

The following is a list of technologies I can help you with:

* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com)
* [React.js](https://reactjs.org)
* [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js)
* [Now.sh](https://now.sh)
* [Micro](https://github.com/zeit/micro)
* Frontend Architecture

If your company is based on **Perú** I can go physically to your office. Outside those places I should do an online streaming or charge you the travel costs in the final price.

If you are interested send me an email to [hello@sergiodxa.com](mailto:hello@sergiodxa.com?subject=Services Teaching)
