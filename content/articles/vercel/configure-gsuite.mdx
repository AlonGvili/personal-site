If you have a domain with the NameServer records handled by Vercel and want to use it with Google Suite you will need to use the CLI to add a few MX records, those records are always the same and only the domain changes, so you can copy the snippet below and put your domain

```bash
now dns add [domain] '@' MX alt1.aspmx.l.google.com 5 && \

now dns add [domain] '@' MX alt2.aspmx.l.google.com 5 && \

now dns add [domain] '@' MX alt3.aspmx.l.google.com 5 && \

now dns add [domain] '@' MX alt4.aspmx.l.google.com 5 && \

now dns add [domain] '@' MX aspmx.l.google.com 5
```

> Note: You can paste the lines above in your terminal with the correct domain and it will automatically work.
