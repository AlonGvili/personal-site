### Prettier

For Prettier I don't like to customize it. The point of Prettier is to stop paying bikeshedding about code style.

### ESLint

I usa few plugins, with their recommended configuration, I don't like to spend too much time thinking about this and I don't like too strict rules, most of the rules I enable are to follow best practices or avoid common mistakes.

- [eslint-plugin-react-hooks](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages/eslint-plugin-react-hooks), to enforce the [Rules of Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html), I use it extending `react-hooks/recommended` to have their recommended config.
- [eslint-plugin-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-plugin-prettier), to let ESLint uses the same code style rules as Prettier, I use it extending `plugin:prettier/recommended` to have their recommended config.
- [eslint-plugin-unicorn](https://github.com/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn), lots of rules to help avoid some errors, I use it extending `plugin:unicorn/recommended` to have their recommended config.
- [eslint-plugin-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/eslint-plugin-testing-library), some helpful rules to follow best practices of Testing Library, I use it extending ``plugin:testing-library/react` to have their recommended config for React.
- [eslint-plugin-cypress](https://github.com/cypress-io/eslint-plugin-cypress), some helpful ruls to avoid common errors when using Cypress, I use it extending `plugin:cypress/recommended` to have their recommended config.
- [eslint-plugin-import](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import), some rules related to imports, I use rules below:
  - `import/no-unresolved`: avoid importing modules that can't be resolved.
  - `import/no-anonymous-default-export`, avoid using export default with anonymous functions, classes and values.
  - `import/resolver`: configure how to resolve imports (required to support absolute paths)

I also use the next rules from ESLint (no plugins required)

- `yoda`, avoid conditions like `"red" === color` and instead force `color === "red"`.
- `func-style`, force a certain way to define functions (except inline functions), I use with to force `declaration` style, this forbids arrow functions for anything except inline functions.
