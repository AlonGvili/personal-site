## Static Testing

> Use ESLint to detect bugs, e.g. typos, and codebase improvements on build time.

> Use TypeScript or FlowType to detect type bugs on build time, and as documentation.

---

## Unit Testing

> Use Jest, or similar tools, to unit test business logic decoupled from UI.

---

## UI Regression Testing with Snapshots

> Use Jest Snapshots, or similar tools, for regression testing of the HTML and CSS.

---

## Integration Tests for Complex Component

> Test the rendered component and interact with it in the test itself.

---

## End to End Tests for Complex Workflows

> Use Puppeteer, Cypress, TestCafe, etc. to test complex workflow as a real user.
